## Distributed Systems

### Drench Game in Flutter

This project was part of an assignment for the Distributed Systems course.

It contains the implementation of the Drench game in multiplayer mode. The goal was to implement communication between two devices via Sockets using TCP, UDP, and gRPC protocols. When establishing the connection, the user chooses which method to use.

More information and code: [https://github.com/AndreNeves97/drench-sd-flutter](https://github.com/AndreNeves97/drench-sd-flutter)


Papers about the work:
- [Multiplayer communication with TCP and UDP](https://github.com/AndreNeves97/AndreNeves97/blob/master/portfolio/academic-papers/SD/SD-Comunicacao-entre-processos-com-TCP-e-UDP.pdf)
- [Multiplayer communication with gRPC](https://github.com/AndreNeves97/AndreNeves97/blob/master/portfolio/academic-papers/SD/SD-Comunicacao-entre-processos-com-gRPC.pdf)

## Microprocessors and microcontrollers

In this course, there was an in-depth study of computer architecture, along with practical activities with microcontrollers.

### LED Cube

One of the projects was the development of an 8x8x8 LED Cube.

### Web-based electrical energy consumption monitoring prototype

This was a project developed before the course, but supervised by the same professor.

The objective was to develop a prototype for monitoring electrical energy consumption via Web, accessible from mobile phones and computers.
